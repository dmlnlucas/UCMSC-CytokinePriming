# UC-MSC Cytokine Priming Analysis

This repository contains the analysis of transcriptomic data from human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) under two different priming conditions:

- **Cytokine-primed UC-MSCs** (IFN-γ + TNF-α + IL-1β) (GSE224190)
- **Single-primed UC-MSCs** (IFN-γ, TNF-α or IL-1β alone) (GSE129165)

The goal is to explore transcriptional changes and identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs), pathways, and biological processes associated with immunomodulatory and angiogenic enhancement. 
Special interest is taken in membrane-associated DEGs, as the end goal is to create cell-derived nanoparticles.
