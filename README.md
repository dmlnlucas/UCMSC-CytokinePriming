# UC-MSC Cytokine Priming Analysis

This repository contains the analysis of transcriptomic data from human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) under two different priming conditions:

- **Cytokine-primed UC-MSCs** (IFN-Î³ + TNF-Î± + IL-1Î²) (GSE224190)
- **Single-primed UC-MSCs** (IFN-Î³, TNF-Î± or IL-1Î² alone) (GSE129165)

The goal is to explore transcriptional changes and identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs), pathways, and biological processes associated with immunomodulatory and angiogenic enhancement. 
There is a special interest in membrane-associated DEGs, as the end goal is to create cell-derived nanoparticles.

## Key findings

- Mixed cytokine priming changes the transcriptional status of a cell, mainly through upregulation of genes. All top 25 DEGs were upregulated in the primed condition.
- Membrane-associated immunmodulatory genes were almost entirely upregulated
- The mixed primed condition had a much larger amount of DEGs compared to the single primed, and a high overlap with single primed
- PCA analysis of all conditions further showed clear transcriptional similarities between TNF-a, IFN-g and the mixed conditions
- A linear regression fit of the logFC showed a significant synergistic effect of mixed cytokine priming compared to single-cytokine priming
